AcadPay is a smart contract that helps students pay their school fees directly to universities using USDC.

How It Works

Universities Register: The AcadPay admin adds universities to the system, giving each a name and a wallet address to receive payments.

Students Pay Fees: Students can pay their fees in USDC to any registered university. Each payment is recorded with details like the studentâ€™s ID, university name, amount, and time.

Secure and Transparent: Every payment is tracked, so both students and universities can see proof of payment.

Features
Only the AcadPay admin can add universities.
Payments are made in USDC, because it is a stable coin.
Each payment is securely recorded and can be checked later.
